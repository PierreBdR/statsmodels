-What's going to need formula information after fitting?
    -predict might need a stateful transform

Provide a layer on top of the current models? So if a formula is given
you get back an object where predict takes non-transformed data, transforms it,
then calls regular predict. Some kind of FormulaWrapper class?

- Summary needs to be able to take Formula
- Charlton could infer more type information for a DataFrame
  - What's the status of categorical factors in Pandas?



Charlton - terms_info should contain an assign and terms in addition to or
instead of terms_to_columns.

If not, given Term, column_info, will column_info always be successive? Ie.,
    (2,4) -> 2 to 4 not (2, 5, 6) -> 2 and 5 and 6?
Could we use an ordereddict for term info so we iterate through in terms of main effects -> higher order terms. (If we have assign and raw_terms this might not be necessary).
