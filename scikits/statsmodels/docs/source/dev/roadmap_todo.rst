Sandbox
^^^^^^^

We currently have a large amount code in the sandbox. The medium term goal
is to move much of this to feature branches as it gets worked on and remove
the sandbox folder. Many of these models and functions are close to done, 
however, and we welcome any and all contributions to complete them, including
refactoring, documentation, and tests.
